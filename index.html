        <p>Uganda is a country in East Africa, known for its rich natural landscapes, diverse wildlife, and friendly people. It lies on the equator, giving it a tropical climate with lush greenery and fertile soils. The country is home to Lake Victoria, the largest lake in Africa, and the source of the Nile River, which flows northward from Uganda through Sudan and Egypt to the Mediterranean Sea.

          Uganda features a mix of savannah, forests, mountains, and wetlands, making it one of the most biodiverse countries in the world. It is famous for Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, where mountain gorillas live, and Murchison Falls, where the Nile River thunders through a narrow gorge.
          
          Kampala is the capital city and the cultural, economic, and political center of the country. Uganda‚Äôs economy is based on agriculture, with growing sectors in tourism.</p>
